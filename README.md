# Web-Scraping-Books-Data

In this personal project, I developed a web scraping tool using Scrapy to extract comprehensive details about books from an online website. The primary objective was to gather key information such as book titles, authors, genres, and prices. The extracted data was then organized into a well-structured format, enabling further analysis and usage. This project demonstrates my proficiency in web scraping, data extraction, and processing using Python, showcasing my ability to automate data collection and handle large datasets effectively. It also highlights my commitment to leveraging technology for efficient data management and analysis.
